# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

# How to run the app successfully?!
  - You can download or clone this repository >= https://github.com/mmeteb9/feed-reader-testing.git
  - Find the index.html file, and open the file in a modern browser.
  - The Jasmine tests are displayed at the bottom of the index.html page.
